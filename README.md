# UniversalGeigerCounter
Building an universal geiger counter based on a STM32 microcontroller.
Features an efficient variable voltage generator to support different tubes and battery operation.
Will be tailored to support the SBM-21 and the SI-14b geiger tubes.

Current status (Oktober 2024): Hardware prototyping the HV generation circuit.
